- Executive summary
This is what makes Cybersecurity most effective. 
-Introduction to Networking
1. Data Transmission 
Packet is known as a unit of data, the reason of how it matches is that when a message is sent to another device, it will break down into smaller pieces. Packet Switching is known as Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destionation address. IP address is known as a set of rules to allow devices to communicate the reason I knew this by the fact that it is written in a 4 decimal points. DNS is known as Directory of IP address common names, I know about this is that if take amazon as a example it has the IP address that has the number 54.239.26.214 will lead to amazon.com. Protocal is known as a set of rules to allow devices to communicate. 
2. Network Hardware
the benefit of a switch over a hub is that switch can reduce any unnecessary traffic on the network. the benefit of a router over hubs and switches is that it is needed for bridging computers and periphereals on a local network to another network or the internet.
3. Network Topologies
A Single point of failure is known as a potential risk posed by a flaw in the design, implementation or configuration of a circuit or system in which one fault or malfunction causes an entire system to stop operating. the topology that experienced this issue is hub. Infrastructure topology and Wireless mesh can be compared to each other for the reason that Wireless mass provides stability when combined with the rest of the network topolgies rather than node addition or deletion. With Infrastructure mesh network, the data forwarding and receiving are via gateway, whereas in the rest of the network, it is through pair of nodes. Infrastructure topology would be better because the wifi can be faster without getting complicated at all.
