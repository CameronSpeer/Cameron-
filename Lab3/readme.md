-Excutive Summary 
This is what makes software important and how each type of software works.
1. Software
The roles of application, utility and operating software is that application software is used as a category of programs that will do something useful for the user, an example of this would be Microsoft's suite of products which are Office, Word, Excel, Powerpoint and so on. Utility Software has software that will allow you to fix or modify the computer in some way, an example of utility software includes Backup software, Disk cleaners, Disk repair, and System Profiles. Operating software manages the hardware and create interface between the hardware and the user, examples of operating software is Microsoft windows, Apple's macOS, Chrome OS, BlackBerry Tablet OS, and Linux. The purpose of ERP is that it was developed to bring together an entire organization in one software application, an example of ERP is Microsoft, Sage, Focus, RAMCO and many others. The purpose of virtualization is that it relies on software to stimulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system.
2. Virtualization 
The types of problems that Virtualization can solve are that companies could partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating system types and versions. Servers started being more efficiently, thereby reducing the costs associated with purchase, set-up, cooling, maintenace. The role that hypervisor plays in virtualization is that it can separate the physical resources from the virtual enviornments - the things that need those resources. the difference between cloud and virtualization is that the cloud can be used to save personal data where as virtualization can just be used to rely on software to stimulate hard ware functionality. a network admin could move from virtualization to cloud computing is that you can create a cloud by pooling virutal resources together, orchestrating them using management and automation software, and creating a self-service portal for users.
3. Python
pseudo-code nature of Python is meant by allowing you to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself. an Interpreted language means that the source code is not translated by the target machine, with compiled language the target machine directly translates the program.
