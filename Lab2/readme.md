-Executive Summary
this is the explaination of the Hardware componets, and Practicing binary, decimal, and hexidecimal
-Hardware 
1. Hard Drives and Memory
The difference between latency and transfer rates in the preformance of a hard drive is that Latency is measured in milliseconds and transfer rates is measured in megabytes per second (MBps). A Solid State (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditonal hard drive is the way the SSD has no spinning platters, no moving heads, it uses either NAND flash or SDRAM (non violate and violate storage respectively). Increasing RAM makes the computer run faster because if the hard drive slows down, the RAM has to go back to the hard drive instead of the CPU hence where increasing the amount of ram makes the computer much faster. The Difference between 64 and 32 bit paths is that the 64 bit uses dimms which are twice as fast than Simms (32 bit).
2. ALU and the Control Unit 
The interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU is that the ALU performs the operation and then outputs the answer, if you have a compare instruction The ALU doesn't need to output an answer instead It just needs to tell the control unit how the two numbers compare to each other for this the ALU uses Flags to help the controls decide on what to do when it recives the next instructions.
3. CPU, Input, & Output
The example addresses CPU, Input, & Output is that the Zebra striped bar code on a item provides the input that has to be scanned by the scanner (CPU) which is then input as a process of binary codes and then soon after the process the output then has the item on the screen to which you can pay it.
4. Logic Gates and Circuts
A truth table is known as a diagram of the outputs from all possible combinations of input. My knowledge of a NAND gate is that it's a digital logic gate with two or more inputs and only one output with a different behavior than that of a AND gate. The NAND gate compares to an AND gate for the fact that the NAND function can also have any number of individual inputs and commerical available NAND Gate IC's are available in standard 2, 3, or 4 input types.
5. IEEE - Ethically Aligned design
The purpose of IEEE is that it is the world's largest technical professional organization. It was designed to serve all professionals involved in all aspects of electrical, electronic, and computing process
-Data Reprepresntaion 
1. Numeric Conversations
The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal numbers is that hexadecimal uses base-sixteen (there are 16 different digits in a single place.) this means that 1-9 are still numbers while 10-15 are now A-F. Decimal has a specific position behind the bigger numbers making the numbers 10x smaller (tenth, hundredth, thousandth). Binary is used for making only two numbers (1 and 0) for the reasoning being that it can only go up to base 2 instead of base 10.
2. Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ff016b in a RGB color space is composed of 100% red, 0.4% green, and 42% blue. I believe that color could very much be problematic in the fact that it wouldn't be an appropriate color when making a website because it simply does not fit well. If I may make a good idea is to just use your standard color palette with out any of the blended colors as text, as long as it isn't white.
-Conclusion
It's fairly easy to know what happens inside the computer and how to make it faster, what happens inside the main pc and what is the process of a CPU, input, output and what color is good when making a website.
